# DataStructuresAssign1


Overview

In this assignment you will be implementing and testing both the Linear Search and Binary Search algorithms that we dicscussed in class.

You will also be writing a driver to test the search algorithms and you will be measuring the run times of each search.
Details

    RunTime Class

    You will write the RunTime.java class which will implement the Runtime Interface , The interface may be downloaded from RuntimeInterface.java
    LinearSearch Class

    You will write the LinearSearch.java class which will inherit from RunTime.java and implement the Search Interface using a linear search algorithm. The interface may be downloaded from SearchInterface.java

    Please note that your search method must measure the run time and add it to the RunTime class by using the addRunTime() method.
    BinarySearch Class

    You will write the BinarySearch.java class which will inherit from RunTime.java and implement the Search Interface using a binary search algorithm. The interface may be downloaded from SearchInterface.java

    Please note that your search method must measure the run time and add it to the RunTime class by using the addRunTime() method.
    Driver Class

    You will write the Driver.java class to test your implementations of:
        RunTime.java
        LinearSearch.java
        BinarySearch.java

    The Driver.java will implement the Driver Interface . The interface may be downloaded from DriverInterface.java
